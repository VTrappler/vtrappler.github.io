  For that I used
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-publish-project-alist ;; https://thackl.github.io/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode-and-jekyll
	  '(("vtrappler.github.io" ;; my blog )
	     ;; Path to org files.
	     :base-directory "~/vtrappler.github.io/org_posts/"
	     :base-extension "org"
	     ;; Path to Jekyll Posts
	     :publishing-directory "~/vtrappler.github.io/_posts/"
	     :recursive t
	     :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
	     :headline-levels 4
	     :html-extension "html"
	     :body-only t
	     )))
