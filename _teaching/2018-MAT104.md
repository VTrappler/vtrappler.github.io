### Description
Enable the students to strengthen their knowledge in mathematics, in order to be able to perform mathematically rigorous proofs on concepts they are bound to use in their physics studies. My role was to help students through lectures and exercises sessions to acquire the required knowledges on Geometry and Algebra. This amounted to 28 hours during the fall semester of 2018.
