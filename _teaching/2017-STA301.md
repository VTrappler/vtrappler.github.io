### Decription
The objective for the students if to acquire and apply classical tools of descriptive statistics, and decisional statistics and its application in biology, using R. My tasks were to help students to reach a basic level of proficiency in the programming language R, in order for them to perform autonomously simple statistical analysis and tests. In addition to that, I graded the students based on their lab exams. I took care in total of 90 hours of lab sessions (5 classes), through the fall semesters of 2017 to 2019.
