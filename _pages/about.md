## Who am I ?

PhD in Applied Mathematics, I started in April 2024 a postdoctoral position at [ICJ](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/icj), hosted at [Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en/research/research-centrale-lyon), where I work on *Multi-Objective Optimization under Uncertainties* using Bayesian Optimization.


Until december 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the joint
laboratory between AI4Sim ([Github public
repo](https://github.com/AI4SIM), which is part of Eviden R&D
department, and [AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/) (Inria
research team).
In this postdoc, I worked on 
* Building preconditioners for Variational Data Assimilation (using ML) [Preprint available here](https://hal.science/hal-04707967)
* Non-Linear Dimension reduction

### Research interests

My research interests are (but not limited to)
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Data Assimilation & ML
* Optimisation Under Uncertainties
* Dimension Reduction
* Calibration of numerical models
