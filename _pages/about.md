Welcome on my personal page, which will be used to share things about
my work. I am still trying to learn the ropes of this setup.

Also, I will try to write some posts about things I care about (mostly
work-related), and share some small personal projects.

Who am I ?

As of december 2021, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the joint
laboratory between AI4Sim ([Github public
repo](https://github.com/AI4SIM), which is part of Atos R&D
department, and [AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/) (Inria
research team), where I work on *Data Assimilation in latent spaces*.
