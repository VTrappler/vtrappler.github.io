Welcome on my personal page, which will be used to share things about
my work. I am still trying to learn the ropes of this setup.

Also, I will try to write some posts about things I care about (mostly
work-related), and share some small personal projects.

Who am I ?
---
PhD in Applied Mathematics, I am looking for a postdoctoral or scientist position.
Until december 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the joint
laboratory between AI4Sim ([Github public
repo](https://github.com/AI4SIM), which is part of Eviden R&D
department, and [AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/) (Inria
research team).
In this postdoc, I worked on 
* Building preconditioners for Variational Data Assimilation (using ML)
* Non-Linear Dimension reduction


<!-- I defended my PhD in June 2021, at the UniversitÃ© Grenoble -->
<!-- Alpes (Grenoble, France), in the Inria research team named -->
<!-- [AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/). -->

Research interests
---
My research interests are (but not limited to)
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Data Assimilation & ML
* Optimisation Under Uncertainties
* Dimension Reduction
* Calibration of numerical models

All of this applied to geophysics.
