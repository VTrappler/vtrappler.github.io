## Who am I ?

PhD in Applied Mathematics, I'm interested in Optimization under Uncertainties, Uncertainty Quantification, Data Assimilation, Machine Learning.

* Starting from September 2025, I am a Maître de Conférences (~associate professor) in the [GMI department](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/recherche/centres-et-departements/departement-genie-mathematique-et-industriel/) of [Institut Henri Fayol](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/recherche/centres-et-departements/institut-henri-fayol/recherche/) and [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/), which is part of [Mines Saint-Etienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/).

* From April 2024 to April 2025, I held a postdoctoral position at [ICJ](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/icj), hosted at [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en/research/research-centrale-lyon), where I worked on *Multi-Objective Optimization under Uncertainties* using Bayesian Optimization.
  * [Multiobjective Optimization under uncertainties using Conditional Pareto Fronts (Preprint)](https://hal.science/hal-04994978) 

* From december 2021 to december 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the joint
laboratory between AI4Sim ([Github public
repo](https://github.com/AI4SIM), which is part of Eviden R&D
department, and [AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/) (Inria
research team).
In this postdoc, I worked on 
  * [Building preconditioners for Variational Data Assimilation using ML (Preprint)](https://hal.science/hal-04707967)
  * Non-Linear Dimension reduction

### Research interests

My research interests are (but not limited to)
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Data Assimilation & ML
* Optimisation Under Uncertainties
* Dimension Reduction
* Calibration of numerical models
