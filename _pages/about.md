Welcome on my personal page, which will be used to share things about
my work. I am still trying to learn the ropes of this setup.

Also, I will try to write some posts about things I care about (mostly
work-related), and share some small personal projects.

Who am I ?
---
I'm a PhD student at the Universit√© Grenoble
Alpes (Grenoble, France), in the Inria research team named
[AIRSEA](https://team.inria.fr/airsea/en/). I will defend my PhD on
the 11th of June 2021.

I'm currently looking for a postdoc position, either in France of abroad.

My research interests are (but not limited to)
* Optimisation Under Uncertainties
* Calibration of numerical models
* Uncertainty Quantifications
* Data assimilation
* Modelling of the ocean

* **Title**: Control of parameters in the presence of uncertainties

* **Abstract**: Many physical phenomena are modelled numerically in
order to better understand and/or to predict their behaviour. However,
some complex and small scale phenomena can not be fully represented in
the models. The introduction of ad-hoc correcting terms is usually the
solution to represent these unresolved processes, but those need to be
properly estimated.  A good example of this type of problem is the
estimation of bottom friction parameters of the ocean floor. This task
is further complicated by the presence of uncertainties in certain
other characteristics linking the bottom and the surface (eg boundary
conditions).  Classical methods of parameter estimation usually imply
the minimisation of an objective function, that measures the error
between some observations and the results obtained by a numerical
model. The optimum is directly dependent on the fixed nominal value
given to the uncertain parameter ; and therefore may not be relevant
in other conditions.  Strategies taking into account those
uncertainties are to be defined and applied on an academic model of a
coastal area, in order to find an optimal value in a robust sense.
